# Explanation on Merge Sort
* Divide and Conquer Algorithm
* Uses **Recursion** to operate on Datasets
* <ins>Performs Well</ins> on Large set of Data
* Performance of **O(n long n)** log Linear time complexity, which is actually better then bubble sort but <ins>not the best</ins>

### Below is the simple representation of how we can merge numbers of two different section which is the part of algorithm in merge sort

It will gonna compare the left most element of both the section and based on comparing result pointer moves forward on the right side respectively for left section and right section.
