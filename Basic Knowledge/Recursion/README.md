# Explanation on Recurssion:
## Advantages of Recursion
- Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
- A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
- Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.

## Disadvantages of Recursion
- Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
- Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
- Recursive functions are hard to debug.
